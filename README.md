# firstTeamProject

Our first team-project with knowledge academy, **team member are Moath Hjjawi @moath00, Hassan Khaleel,Yazan Dalbah and Baraa, with supervisor Tariq Shreem, and mentor Dalia Alawneh**. We sliced the project to four parts, first part was navbar, header and footer (Hasan part),  second part was navs, tabs section, and our services section(Baraa part), third part was autobiography section, gallary section and book promotion section(Yazan part), last part was events pages(Moath part).

The work we wanted to do was **practice for GitHub team work** and make project using Html, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript and JQuery. Now, we done with Html, CSS, Bootstrap, next work will be on JS and JQuery.

This **website work** like a book shop and events organiser, you can view the books available and take a look on writers and new works (books) and events they do.

Hope you to give **feedback and tips** to improve our skills and our work mindset.
